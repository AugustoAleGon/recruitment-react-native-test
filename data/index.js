A media report claimed that the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform (Beijing DRC) raided 5i5j Group’s office on 10 September over suspected anticompetitive conduct. However, the real estate brokerage said the Beijing DRC’s visit was for a routine exchange of information and did not involve any price-related investigation.
